Introduction: RAISE A SUILEN's ace producer and writer and composer of the band's songs. Although she can be childish and selfish at times, her passion for music is first-rate. She used to have issues with regard to her world-class musician mother but overcame them with the help of the band. Loves jerky.



Tamade Chiyu is a third-year returnee student at Celosia International School and the leader of and producer and DJ for RAISE A SUILEN going by the stage name CHU² (チュチュ), read as CHUCHU. Due to her excellent grades, she was accelerated to a grade higher than her age.
She uses DTM (Desktop Music) to compose music.

She is very rich. She lives in a penthouse where the band also practices at.



# Background

Ever since she was young, Chiyu has been involved with music and played different kinds of instruments such as the piano and violin. However, she did not start playing out of her own will, but rather because of her parents' high expectations - particularly her mother Miu, who is a famous violinist working overseas. Despite Chiyu's inadequate skills and the pressure her mother put on her, Miu was always telling Chiyu to keep working hard and doing what she thought was the best for her only daughter.

As a result, this led to Chiyu wanting to put together the ultimate band all by herself, as she believes that by doing everything herself, it would force people to recognize her talents.



# Appearance

Chiyu is a short girl. She has sky-blue eyes with voluminous, salmon-colored hair reaching her hips, and a tall single ahoge.

She is normally seen wearing her school uniform, which consists of a white buttoned shirt with a red and white striped tie, a dark blue school blazer, a plaid miniskirt, black crew socks, and brown loafers. She also wears black cat-eared headphones.



# Personality

Chiyu is very professional, confident, and stubborn about her band and ideas, and likes calling herself a "kind, generous producer". She tends to be quite arrogant and aggressive towards the other bands, as well as her own band members at times; however, she refrains from being rude. While she sometimes has outbursts and yells at her band members, she has admitted to having trouble with controlling her emotions and finding the right words, and tends to get depressed after realizing what she'd done. She also used to be lonely before forming the band, and despite frequently denying it, Chiyu enjoys trying out new things and going to different places with her bandmates.

As a result of her studying in an international school, she often speaks English or adds English words to her sentences, and even refers to herself with the katakana spelling of watashi (ワタシ).

When she gets immersed in track making and song producing, she has a tendency to skip meals and even sleep under her computer's desk.
